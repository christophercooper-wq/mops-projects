# ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENT: STRUCTURE & ALIGNMENT GAPS

**Document Status**: ✅ Complete
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-12

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Lifecycle Marketing Manager role failed due to **strategic misalignment at the leadership level**, not operational execution issues. Three qualified candidates (Lily Tam, Josh Giamboi, Maria Amorosso) received unanimous 7/7 "YES" scores from interview panels but were collectively rejected because:

1. **Tommy McNulty (CRO)** wanted Demand Generation (TOF/pipeline focus)
2. **Job Description** asked for Lifecycle Marketing (MOF/BOF/retention focus)
3. **Interview Panel** evaluated for lifecycle competencies
4. **Role Definition** never aligned between stakeholders

**No hire will succeed** until leadership aligns on: role type (demand gen vs lifecycle), ownership model (RACI), and infrastructure investment.

```

**Source**: `Org Chart/general_bamboohr_org_chart.csv` (BambooHR export, October 2025)

### **Key Insights**

1. **Christopher Cooper (you) reports to Anthony Hwang (RevOps)**, NOT Jeremy Liang (Growth)
   - This creates **cross-functional dependency** for any Growth team hire
   - Lifecycle/Demand Gen Manager will need YOU for execution but can't directly manage you
   - Success requires tight collaboration protocol

2. **Anthony Hwang manages both RevOps AND Marketing Ops**
   - Reporting line: Anthony → Tommy (CRO)
   - Dual responsibility creates potential conflict: sales ops vs marketing ops priorities

3. **Jeremy Liang (Head of Growth) has ZERO direct reports currently**
   - Lifecycle/Demand Gen hire would be first Growth team member
   - No existing team to onboard into
   - High bus factor risk (sole lifecycle/demand gen person)

4. **Justin Wolz (Marketing Lead) has only Yejee Pae (Designer)**
   - Marketing = Brand + Content
   - Does NOT include Growth, Lifecycle, or Demand Gen
   - Separation between "Marketing" and "Growth" is intentional but creates confusion

---

## ROLE MISALIGNMENT: DEMAND GEN VS LIFECYCLE

### **The Confusion**

**Job Description Title**: "Lifecycle Marketing Manager"
**Reporting Line**: Jeremy Liang (Head of Growth)
**Tommy's Expectation**: Demand Generation (pipeline acceleration)
**JD Content**: Lifecycle (retention, engagement, long-term value)

### **What Each Term Actually Means**

| Aspect | Demand Generation | Lifecycle Marketing | Rho's Need |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Funnel Focus** | TOF/MOF (acquisition + nurture) | MOF/BOF (engagement + retention) | Tommy wants TOF |
| **Primary Metrics** | MQL/SQL volume, CAC, conversion rates | LTV, churn, retention, expansion revenue | Tommy measures pipeline |
| **Timeframe** | Short-term (weeks) | Long-term (months/years) | Tommy wants velocity |
| **Typical Channels** | Paid ads, SEO, events, webinars | Email nurture, SMS, in-app, lifecycle journeys | Rho does events heavily |
| **Technical Skills** | Channel optimization, analytics, A/B testing | Marketing automation, segmentation, journey orchestration | Both needed |

### **The Job Description** (Actual Language)

From `JD - Lifecycle Marketing Manager.pdf`:

> "We're looking for a Lifecycle Marketing Manager who is obsessive about segmentation, personalization, and moving customers to action. You'll own the entire lifecycle, from the first sign-up moment to launch, expansion, and retention. You'll be the architect behind hundreds of micro-targeted flows that work together to convert, activate, and retain customers at scale."

**This is CLASSIC LIFECYCLE** → Long-term nurture, retention focus

### **Tommy's Actual Need** (Inferred from Context)

**From Strategic Audit notes**:
> "Tommy seems focused on TOF/Sales Pipeline"

**What this means**:
- MQL/SQL volume (fill sales pipeline)
- Speed-to-lead (get leads to sales faster)
- Campaign velocity (launch more, faster)
- Attribution (know which channels work)

**This is DEMAND GENERATION** → Acquisition and pipeline acceleration

### **Interview Panel Evaluated for Wrong Thing**

**Lily Tam's Competency Scores** (7/7 across panel):

| Competency | Score | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Builder Mindset | ✅ Strong | Built lifecycle program 0→1 at Flipkart |
| Customer-First Thinking | ✅ Strong | Segmented by industry, geography, company size |
| Analytical Project Excellence | ✅ Strong | 40% MQL increase, 20% SQL conversion, A/B testing |
| Detail/Eye for Excellence | ✅ Strong | Created segmented email templates |

**Christopher Cooper's Feedback**:
> "Lily tends to be a potentially strong fit with 1-2 more validations needed"

**Jeremy Liang's Feedback**:
> "Better experience and stronger fit for lifecycle role. We have better candidates in the pipeline."

**Translation**: Lily is great for LIFECYCLE, but Tommy wants DEMAND GEN, and Jeremy may have demand gen candidates elsewhere.

---

## LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENT GAPS

### **Christopher Cooper's Diagnosis** (October 27, 2025 Slack)

**To Anthony Hwang**:

> "RE: Role and Responsibilities. OKRs/Goals for each department. There is some ambiguity, but it could likely be navigated. My concern centers on what leadership's expectations are – e.g., the Lifecycle seems to be misaligned strategically. For instance, based on Tommy's feedback regarding the candidates, it appears that the role might be better framed as Demand Generation."

**Key Questions Christopher Asked** (Still Unanswered):

| Question | Why It Matters | Current Answer |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| What team owns data infrastructure? | Determines who fixes event emission gap | ❓ Unclear (Eng? Data? RevOps?) |
| What team owns tool acquisition? | Determines who can approve Segment, Storyblok, Customer.io | ❓ Unclear (Anthony? Tommy? Finance?) |
| What team owns experimentation? | Determines who runs A/B tests, campaigns | ❓ Unclear (Growth? MOps?) |
| How does the org support MOF/BOF? | Determines if lifecycle marketing is even possible | ❓ No strategy defined |

### **The Access Problem**

**From CHANGELOG context**:

> "Christopher never met Tommy, Justin, or Everett (leadership)"
> "Asked Anthony for Tommy's calendar for 'perspective of his vision'"
> "Anthony responded asking to 'chat 1:1 first' - gatekeeping access"

**What This Reveals**:
- Christopher (MOps) doesn't have direct access to CRO to understand strategy
- Must go through Anthony (manager) who must go through Tommy
- **Communication gap** prevents understanding of true requirements

### **The RevOps Thread** (October 2025 Slack)

**Christopher to Anthony**:
> "QQ: Would it be possible to get time on Tommy's calendar before ~mid-Nov to get perspective of his vision for Growth/RevOps/Rho, etc?"

**Anthony's Response**:
> "Hey do you want to chat about this 1:1 and we can go from there? What do you need for me around the role and the responsibilities?"

**Christopher's Clarification**:
> "Sure, can chat 1:1 – though only looking for perspective since I've never actually had a conversation with anyone in leadership (Tommy, Justin, Everett, etc)."

**This is a RED FLAG**: Marketing Ops doesn't understand leadership vision because they're not included in strategic conversations.

---

## OWNERSHIP MODEL GAPS

### **No RACI Chart Exists**

RACI = Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed

| Responsibility | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Data Infrastructure** (Schemas, ETL, event emission) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **Tool Acquisition** (HubSpot, Segment, Customer.io) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **Campaign Experimentation** (A/B tests, launches) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **MOF/BOF Strategy** (Nurture, retention programs) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **Speed-to-Lead** (Real-time lead acceleration) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **Attribution** (Primary Inbound Channel, ROI tracking) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **HubSpot Governance** (Workflow creation, property management) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| **Events Process** (Luma uploads, nurture sequences) | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |

**Result**: When something breaks or needs to be built, nobody knows whose job it is.

### **Example: The 45-Minute Gap**

**Who Should Fix Real-Time Event Emission?**

- **Engineering?** They own Signup Services codebase, could emit events
- **Data Team?** They run warehouse syncs, could speed them up (expensive)
- **RevOps?** They need data in Salesforce for sales
- **Marketing Ops?** They need data in HubSpot for campaigns
- **Product?** They prioritize feature roadmap

**Current Answer**: Nobody is assigned → Nobody fixes it → 45-minute lag persists

## INTERVIEW PROCESS BREAKDOWN

### **Lifecycle Manager Interview Panel**

| Role | Name | Department | Interview Focus | Competency Assessed |
|------|------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Talent Screening** | Emma Gannon | Recruiting | Basic competency | All (initial filter) |
| **Hiring Manager** | Jeremy Liang | Growth | Builder qualities, Growth fit | 5 key sequences, data approach |
| **Cross-Functional** | Christopher Cooper | Marketing Ops | Ops collaboration | HTML/email coding, project mgmt |
| **Cross-Functional** | Yejee Pae | Design | Design collaboration | Brand partnership |
| **Marketing Fit** | Justin Wolz | Marketing | B2B marketing | Email strategy, customer language |
| **Final Round** | Tommy McNulty | GTM Leadership | GTM alignment | Differentiation, accomplishments |

**Process was well-designed** → 6 stages, clear competencies, structured questions

**Problem was upstream** → Wrong role definition, not interview execution

### **Lily Tam: Unanimous YES, Still Rejected**

**Initial Screening (Emma Gannon)**:
> "Has been learning lifecycle marketing at Flipkart and made a big impact on B2B revenue. Only lifecycle marketer at Flipkart - built it independently. Led 40% increase in MQLs (20% converting to SQLs)."

**Recommendation**: 7 - YES

**Hiring Manager (Jeremy Liang)**:
> "Better experience and stronger fit for lifecycle role. We have better candidates in the pipeline. Our data isn't perfect for Rho - how do you improve the bar in spite of that?"

**Recommendation**: 7 - YES (but notes "better candidates" elsewhere)

**Christopher Cooper (MOps)**:
> "Potentially strong fit with 1-2 more validations needed. Worked closely with ops teams on lifecycle projects. Solid HTML/email coding experience."

**Recommendation**: 7 - YES

**Result**: All 7s across panel → Rejected anyway

**Why?** Tommy's unstated requirement (demand gen, not lifecycle) wasn't in interview rubric

---

## STRATEGIC MISALIGNMENT: GROWTH VS MARKETING

### **What IS Growth? What IS Marketing?**

**From Strategic Audit**:

**Growth Team** (Jeremy Liang):
- Rapid customer acquisition and activation
- Short-term experimentation and testing
- Top and mid-funnel optimization
- Paid acquisition, SEO, conversion rate optimization
- **Metrics**: CAC, MQL/SQL volume, conversion rates, acquisition velocity

**Marketing Team** (Justin Wolz):
- Brand positioning
- Content creation
- Corporate marketing
- **Does NOT include**: Growth, Lifecycle, Demand Gen

**Lifecycle** (Role being hired for):
- Long-term customer retention and engagement
- Customer journey orchestration across all stages
- Post-purchase activation, retention, expansion, winback
- Email, SMS, in-app messaging, customer communication programs
- **Metrics**: LTV, churn rate, retention, engagement, expansion revenue

### **The Disconnect**

**Tommy (CRO) Needs**:
- TOF: Fill sales pipeline with qualified leads
- Speed: Get leads to sales faster
- Volume: More MQLs, more SQLs

**JD Asks For**:
- MOF/BOF: Retain and expand existing customers
- Long-term: Build lifetime value
- Sophistication: Hundreds of micro-targeted flows

**These are DIFFERENT JOBS** → Tommy will reject any lifecycle candidate because it's not what he needs

---

## CANDIDATE PROFILES (SUMMARY)

### **Lily Tam** ⭐ Strongest Lifecycle Fit

**Background**:
- Flipkart (B2B): Only lifecycle marketer, built 0→1
- Improved nurture: "Informational → highly engaged"
- 40% MQL increase, 20% SQL conversion
- Segmented templates: Industry, geography, company size
- AB testing expertise

**Why She Fit Lifecycle**:
- ✅ Solo builder (no team to inherit)
- ✅ Data-driven (40% lift with imperfect data)
- ✅ HTML/email technical skills
- ✅ Ops collaboration (worked with ops teams closely)

**Why She Didn't Fit Demand Gen**:
- ⚠️ No paid acquisition experience mentioned
- ⚠️ No event marketing at scale
- ⚠️ No channel optimization (SEO, SEM)

**Interview Outcome**: 7/7 YES across all interviewers → Rejected

### **Josh Giamboi** (Limited Details)

**Status**: Interview briefing PNG visible but details not extracted in analysis
**Outcome**: Rejected

### **Maria Amorosso** (Limited Details)

**Status**: Interview briefing PNG visible but details not extracted in analysis
**Outcome**: Rejected

### **Pattern**: All 3 candidates rejected despite positive scores

**Conclusion**: Not a talent problem, a strategic alignment problem

## WHY LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENT MEETING IS CRITICAL

### **Decisions That MUST Be Made (Week 1)**

| Decision | Options | Impact if Not Made |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **1. Role Type** | Demand Gen OR Lifecycle | Can't write correct JD, will hire wrong person again |
| **2. Funnel Ownership** | Who owns TOF? MOF? BOF? | Can't set success metrics |
| **3. RACI Chart** | Who owns data, tools, experiments | Can't assign accountability for infrastructure |
| **4. Budget Authority** | Who approves $32K Skydog? Future tools? | Can't execute remediation plan |
| **5. MOps Support SLA** | What can Growth hire expect from Christopher? | Unclear collaboration protocol |
| **6. Success Metrics** | MQL/SQL or LTV/retention? | Can't measure if hire is succeeding |

### **Who Must Attend**

- ✅ **Tommy McNulty** (CRO) - Provides CRO perspective, decides on pipeline priorities
- ✅ **Jeremy Liang** (Head of Growth) - Hiring manager, owns role execution
- ✅ **Anthony Hwang** (RevOps/MOps Manager) - Owns infrastructure, manages Christopher
- ⚠️ **Christopher Cooper** (MOps) - Presents data, documents decisions
- ⚠️ **Justin Wolz** (Marketing Lead) - Optional: Clarifies Marketing vs Growth boundary

### **Meeting Agenda (60 minutes)**

**Preparation** (Christopher, before meeting):
- Share README.md, 01-root-cause-analysis.md, 02-organizational-assessment.md (this doc)
- Create slide deck: Role comparison table, candidate feedback summary, infrastructure blockers

**Meeting Flow**:

1. **Context** (5 min) - Christopher presents: Why 3 candidates rejected, infrastructure gaps
2. **Decision 1** (15 min) - Demand Gen vs Lifecycle?
   - Tommy: What do you actually need?
   - Jeremy: Can you hire for that?
   - Outcome: Role type decided
3. **Decision 2** (15 min) - Funnel ownership + RACI
   - Who owns TOF? (Demand Gen if chosen)
   - Who owns MOF/BOF? (Undefined currently)
   - Who owns data infrastructure, tools, experiments?
   - Outcome: RACI chart drafted
4. **Decision 3** (10 min) - Budget + Timeline
   - Approve Skydog 3-phase SOW? ($32K already approved, confirm scope)
   - Q1 2026 hire timeline realistic?
   - Outcome: Budget confirmed, timeline agreed
5. **Decision 4** (10 min) - MOps Support SLA
   - What can Growth hire expect from Christopher?
   - Response time for workflow changes, new integrations?
   - Outcome: SLA documented
6. **Wrap** (5 min) - Christopher documents decisions, shares CHANGELOG entry

### **If Meeting Doesn't Happen**

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Skydog Ops will audit HubSpot but can't advise on strategic direction
- ✅ Infrastructure improvements happen but may not align with role needs
- ✅ Role reopens with same wrong JD → hire fails again
- ✅ 8-week project timeline at risk (blocked on strategic decisions)

**Escalation Path**: Christopher → Anthony → Tommy (force scheduling)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### **1. Redefine Role as Demand Generation** (Recommended)

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with Tommy's TOF/pipeline focus
- Leverages existing events infrastructure (10+ events/week)
- Addresses current pain points (campaign velocity, speed-to-lead)
- Can add lifecycle later once foundation stable

**New Role Title**: "Demand Generation Manager" or "Growth Marketing Manager"

**Revised JD Focus**:
- Event marketing (Luma integration, partner events)
- Paid acquisition (if budget available)
- Campaign velocity (launch fast, iterate faster)
- Attribution (fix Primary Inbound Channel chaos)
- Speed-to-lead (work with Eng on event emission)

**Success Metrics**:
- MQL/SQL volume
- Campaign deployment velocity (<4 hours, from 2-4 days)
- Event conversion rates
- Attribution accuracy

### **2. OR: Keep as Lifecycle BUT Define BOF Strategy First**

**Rationale**: If Rho truly needs retention/expansion focus

**Pre-Requisites**:
- Define what "retention" means at Rho (churn reduction? expansion revenue?)
- Clarify interface with Customer Success team
- Establish BOF success metrics (LTV, expansion %, churn rate)
- Accept that infrastructure fixes must come first (can't do lifecycle without data)

**Timeline**: Adds 4-6 weeks to hiring timeline (strategy definition first)

### **3. Create RACI Chart (Required Regardless)**

**Proposed RACI**:

| Responsibility | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Data Infrastructure** | Data Team | CTO | RevOps, MOps, Eng | Growth, Marketing |
| **Tool Acquisition** | Anthony (RevOps) | Tommy (CRO) | Finance, Data | MOps, Growth |
| **Campaign Experimentation** | Growth Team | Jeremy | MOps, Marketing | Leadership |
| **MOF/BOF Strategy** | TBD (if Lifecycle) | Jeremy | Customer Success | MOps |
| **Speed-to-Lead** | RevOps + MOps | Anthony | Eng, Data | Sales |
| **Attribution** | MOps | Anthony | RevOps, Growth | Leadership |
| **HubSpot Governance** | MOps | Anthony | Growth, Marketing | Leadership |
| **Events Process** | Growth Team | Jeremy | MOps, Partners | Marketing |

### **4. Establish MOps Support SLA**

**For Demand Gen/Lifecycle Hire**:

| Request Type | Response Time | Owner | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|
| **Workflow Changes** (minor) | <24 hours | Christopher | Small tweaks to existing |
| **New Workflows** | <3 days | Christopher | Requires testing |
| **New Integrations** | <1 week | Christopher + Anthony | Requires approval |
| **Custom Development** | <2 weeks | Christopher | Requires scoping |
| **Emergency Fixes** | <4 hours | Christopher | Production issues |

---

## CONCLUSION

**The Lifecycle Manager hire failed because**:

1. **Role Misalignment**: Tommy wanted demand gen, JD asked for lifecycle
2. **No RACI Chart**: Unclear who owns data, tools, experiments, MOF/BOF
3. **Access Gaps**: Christopher never met leadership, couldn't understand vision
4. **Strategic Ambiguity**: Growth vs Marketing roles unclear

**No candidate will succeed until**:

1. ✅ Leadership alignment meeting (Week 1) makes decisions
2. ✅ Role redefined (Demand Gen recommended)
3. ✅ RACI chart created (ownership clarity)
4. ✅ Infrastructure stabilized (Skydog 8-week project)

**Next Action**: Request Tommy/Jeremy/Anthony meeting (60 min, Week 1)
